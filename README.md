# Dijkstra’s Algorithm Maze Solver

This project is a Python program that uses **Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm** to solve a maze.  
It shows the maze in a Tkinter window where:

- **Black** = walls  
- **White** = open paths  
- **Red** = start point  
- **Blue** = end point  
- **Green** = shortest path found  

Just run the script and the window will display the maze with the path from start to end.
